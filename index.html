            <p>Meet Rio, each individual has their own advantages because we eat and drink on the same earth. His journey into the world of the internet began at the end of 2015 when he became known as a Network Expert. He did all this because of a hobby.</p>
            <p>Unlike the famous experts who went to internet schools, Rio's education was completely self-taught. He began his search by entering internet communities and actively participating in discussion forums. It was at this time that the field piqued his interest. Rio was fascinated by the idea of ​​commanding a computer remotely. He can now connect computers all over the world.</p>
            <p>Currently Rio lives in Indramayu, Indonesia with his wife, and sometimes conducts experiments on his personal computer. When he is not busy he likes to write poetry in HTML, JS, PHP, Java, etc. In the last few years, he and his colleagues have succeeded in creating a private server.</p>
            <p>What you're doing is figuring out technology and experimenting in ways that many people never imagined. They also have a strong desire to share this information and explain it to people who want to learn.</p>
            <p>The me now, will definitely thank the old me for not giving up. You are extraordinary!</p>
